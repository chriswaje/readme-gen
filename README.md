# README file generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to learn how to use NodeJS and use inquirer as a means to generate a README file by answering prompts. The motivation for this project was to solidify an understanding of NodeJS and the inquirer dependency. This project was built to create an application that auto-generates a professional README file for user projects in a convenient way by answer a series of questions based on the desired project. The problem this solves is creating an efficient method in creating README markdown files for future projects to be built. Through the course of building this project, lessons in NodeJS, inquirer, and back-end development were learned. 

## Installation

To install the project, users should open the integrated terminal and type the command "npm install," or "npm i" for short, which will prompt the device to install the proper packages for inquire. 

## Usage

In order to use the application, users will right-click on the index.js file and type the command "node index." This will run the application and begin a series of questions for users to answer regarding the project they wish to target when generating the README file. Once users have answered all the prompt questions, a README.md file will be generated in the "build" folder. 

## Credits

NodeJS for the open-source server environment. NPM for the software registry and inquire for the npm package that was used to prompt questions for users when generating the README file. Diarmuid Murphy for assistance in object deconstructon to further sleek the design of the coding process. Meg Meyers for assistance in creating conditional statements for rendering the license section of the generated README file based on the user's selection of a license or none.
